            The reality that women face significant barriers in the working world has been an unfortunately long-term
            aspect of our
            society. On the whole, women are <a
                href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/03/24/482141/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/">paid
                less for equal work</a>, have greater <a

                work</a>, and are
            expected more
            often to shoulder the <a
                href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/ ">responsibilities
                of family care</a> , for which they often have to adjust their careers.
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/economy/pandemic-women-tenure.html">The effects of
                COVID-19</a> have only exacerbated these structural inequalities against women in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-academia/">Academia</a> is no exception to these
            structural forces. We used <a href="https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/datadownload/">the 2017 NSF Survey of
                Doctorate Recipients</a>,
            a survey
            that asks more than 120,000 Doctoral Graduates about their career paths and priorities, to bring a
            quantitative
            approach to studying the experiences of women in academia. We hope these visualizations will bring greater
            clarity to
            the pathways of women in academia, their priorities, and the structural barriers they face in succeeding.

        <p>The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/data-tools.cfm#micro-data">Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR)
            </a>, conducted by the National Center for Science and
            Engineering
            Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation, provides data on the characteristics of
            science,
            engineering, and health (SEH) doctorate degree holders. It samples individuals who have earned an SEH
            research doctoral degree from
            a U.S. academic institution and are less than 76 years of age. The SDR provides data useful in assessing
            the
            supply
            and characteristics of the nation's SEH doctorates employed in educational institutions, private
            industry,
            and
            professional organizations, as well as in federal, state, and local governments.

        <p>The chart above provides a spread of those in academia by race, gender, and age. This chart makes clear that
            the number of men in academia has largely stayed the same while the number of women has risen over the past
            few decades. This chart suggests that pushes towards gender parity in the Academy might not "push out" men but instead accomodate the growing need for Doctoral Graduates in Industry and Academia.</p>

    <h2>PhD Recipients by Race</h2>
    <div id="race2Vis"></div>
    </br>

    <div class="text">
        <p>Here, we zoom in specifically on Race to see that Doctoral Students of Asian descent have seen the greatest
            increase. It's important to recognize that even though we see total numbers of women increasing, those
            gains are not
            equally distributed racially. While the rise in Women who recieve PhDs is something to celebrate, we should remain cognizant of how racial inequalities impact gender equity.</p>

        <p>This visualization shows the representation gap between men and women by industry over time. We can see here, for example,
            that women
            are actually more represented in the Social Sciences but face significant representation challenges in
            Engineering and
            Computer Science. Overall, the gap between men and women is declining over time. Another interesting
            discovery is that,
            on the Academia side, the count of female PhDs is larger than male PhDs for the participants under 40 years
            old, while
            on the Industry side, male participants are more than female participants for all age groups. Crafting effective policy or institutional efforts for gender equality should keep in mind that gender equity looks very different depending on discipline.

        <p>Here we can see the wage gap of women with PhDs by industry. From the graph, it's clear that men make more
            than
            women in nearly every field, with the only significant wage gap that favors women present in pre-college
            teaching. In some fields, women are making less than $20,000 less annually than their male
            counterparts. This visualization effectively highlights which areas should be the highest priority for reform, either from Institutions themselves or through legislation.

        <p>This visualization shows the spread of female salaries by age and sector. This graph reveals that women in
            computer science often have much more stable salaries over the course of their careers than women in
            biological sciences, whose early career salaries are $20-30,000 less. Because women are often responsible for a majority of family care, this graph could also aid in understanding which sectors impact women more by paying them less during times of family and financial stress.

            specific age group to understand that particular group by sector.</p>

        <p>Here, the top graph offers a clear view of the rise of more-than-full-time working women in Academia. The
            bottom chart
            displays the percentages of each group, which can help us understand that even accounting for the rise in
            younger women
            working more, there is a consistent gap between men and women who works more than full-time hours. Women are often unable to take up such work due to other responsibilities such as family care or childcare. Intense work can also be critical for younger Doctoral graduates for promotion opportunies and tenure consideration.</p>

    <h2>Importance of Social Impact By Gender and Sector</h2>

            contribution from each neighbor and its percentage make-up by gender on the left.</li>
    </div>


    <div class="text">
        <p>Here we see that women are significantly more likely to highly rate the
            importance of social impact in their research and career priorities. This holds important implications for
            how gender parity (or the lack thereof) affects the priorities of Doctoral graduates.</p>

        <p>To explore the data yourself, hover over any linkage to understand its pathway through the graph and hover
            over a vertical bar to show its individual contribution to each neighboring category and the overall
            percentage of men and women for each category. For example, we can compare the total percentages of men and
            women (42% and 58%) by hovering over the vertical leftmost bar. Then, we can examine the makeup of those who
            marked "Somewhat Unimportant" in the Importance of Social Impact by hovering over its vertical bar to see
            that it is composed of 29% men and 71% women.</p>

    </div>
    </br>

    <div class="text">
        <p>This visualization shows the intersection of gender and sector on Benefits Satisfaction. While the proportion
            of those "Very Satisfied" with their benefits is consistent with the overall count of men and women, the
            proportion of those who are "Somewhat" or "Very Dissatisfied" skews significantly towards women. This
            visualization also reveals that although academia is on the whole reaching gender parity, the number of
            women in Industry is still significantly lower. These findings are consistent with our earlier assumptions -
            that women are more likely to be shouldered with childcare responsibilities and may prioritize the
            flexibility offered by academia over an industry job. </p>

        <p>These two charts reveal who has to shoulder the responsibilities of family care. We can see from the top

            significantly around the time when many choose to raise younger children, around 35-45 years old. The bottom

        <p>This project examined the role of women in academia across lines of race, sector, wage, and priorities. We
            found that while recently women have been making strong gains for gender parity on the whole, for specific
            sectors and for minorities such as Black and Latinx women, gender parity has a long way to go. For nearly
            every sector, men make significantly more than their female counterparts. For all the stark structural
            issues this data presents, it importantly leaves out the many women who wanted to obtain a PhD but were
            unable to due to structural barriers. Especially in sectors like computer science where men still outnumber
            women by a wide margin, it is clear that women are being recruited into programs less, actively pushed out
            of programs more, and are not given positions as lucrative or as often. We also showed that women value the social impact of their work more highly than men and prioritize their employment benefits more highly, perhaps due to their greater responsibilities associated with family and child care. In working towards gender parity within the academy and in industry, understanding the unique structural challenges women face in their careers is key to shaping effective policy and reform.</p>
