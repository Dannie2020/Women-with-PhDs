            The reality that women face significant barriers in the working world has been an unfortunately long-term
            aspect of our
            society. On the whole, women are <a
                href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/03/24/482141/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/">paid
                less for equal work</a>, have greater <a

                work</a>, and are
            expected more
            often to shoulder the <a
                href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/ ">responsibilities
                of family care</a> , for which they often have to adjust their careers.
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/economy/pandemic-women-tenure.html">The effects of
                COVID-19</a> have only exacerbated these structural inequalities against women in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-academia/">Academia</a> is no exception to these
            structural forces. We used <a href="https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/datadownload/">the 2017 NSF Survey of
                Doctorate Recipients</a>,
            a survey
            that asks more than 120,000 Doctoral Graduates about their career paths and priorities, to bring a
            quantitative
            approach to studying the experiences of women in academia. We hope these visualizations will bring greater
            clarity to
            the pathways of women in academia, their priorities, and the structural barriers they face in succeeding.

        <p>The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/data-tools.cfm#micro-data">Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR)
            </a>, conducted by the National Center for Science and
            Engineering
            Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation, provides data on the characteristics of
            science,
            engineering, and health (SEH) doctorate degree holders. It samples individuals who have earned an SEH
            research doctoral degree from
            a U.S. academic institution and are less than 76 years of age. The SDR provides data useful in assessing
            the
            supply
            and characteristics of the nation's SEH doctorates employed in educational institutions, private
            industry,
            and
            professional organizations, as well as in federal, state, and local governments.

        <p>The chart above provides a spread of those in academia by race, gender, and age. This chart makes clear that
            the number of men in academia has largely stayed the same while the number of women has risen over the past
            few decades. </p>

        <p>This visualization shows the representation gap between men and women by industry over time. We can see here
            that women
            are actually more represented in the Social Sciences but face significant representation challenges in
            Engineering and
            Computer Science. Overall, the gap between men and women is declining over time. Another interesting
            discovery is that,
            on the Academia side, the count of female PhDs is larger than male PhDs for the participants under 40 years
            old, while
            on the Industry side, male participants are more than female participants for all age groups.

            biological sciences, whose early career salaries are $20-30,000 less. To explore on your own, sort by a

        <p>This visualization shows the intersection of gender and sector on Benefits Satisfaction. While the proportion
            of those "Very Satisfied" with their benefits is consistent with the overall count of men and women, the
            proportion of those who are "Somewhat" or "Very Dissatisfied" skews significantly towards women. This
            visualization also reveals that although academia is on the whole reaching gender parity, the number of
            women in Industry is still significantly lower. These findings are consistent with our earlier assumptions -
            that women are more likely to be shouldered with childcare responsibilities and may prioritize the
            flexibility offered by academia over an industry job. </p>

    <div class="text">
        <p>These two charts reveal who has to shoulder the responsibilities of family care. We can see from the top

            significantly around the time when many choose to raise younger children, around 35-45 years old. The bottom

        <p>This project examined the role of women in academia across lines of race, sector, wage, and priorities. We
            found that while recently women have been making strong gains for gender parity on the whole, for specific
            sectors gender parity has a long way to go. For nearly
            every sector, men make significantly more than their female counterparts. For all the stark structural
            issues this data presents, it importantly leaves out the many women who wanted to obtain a PhD but were
            unable to due to structural barriers. Especially in sectors like computer science where men still outnumber
            women by a wide margin, it is clear that women are being recruited into programs less, actively pushed out
            of programs more, and are not given positions as lucrative or as often. </p>
